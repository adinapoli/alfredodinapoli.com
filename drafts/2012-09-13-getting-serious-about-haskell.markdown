For my entire development life, I've always tried to go in breadth rather
than in depth. This means that I focused in learning every kind of
languages/technologies available, always with a lot of commitment. I've
learned about fantastic language and technologies, and I think that the
result was worth my time. Now that I'm a little more mature rathen then
I was 5 years ago, it's time for me to go in depth, focusing on what I
really like and what I want to turn into a profession.

<h2 id="first">Welcome to my website</h2>
<img class="instant itiltleft icolorFFFCE9 ishadow50 left" src="img/alfredo3.png" width="250">
<p>Hi, I'm Alfredo Di Napoli, and I'm a 24-year-old guy with passion for technology.
I'm an inquisitive person, and an eager devourer of technical books. I'm geek
enough to have opinions about publishing houses: My favourite one is <i>Addison Wesley</i>,
but I'm also fond of <i>No Starch Press</i> for the beautiful books about Common Lisp
and Haskell, and I appreciate the variety of topics covered by <i>O'Reilly</i> (they have
published a book about Haskell Web development with Yesod!)</p>

<p>Within this site you will find every piece of information about me: my portfolio, my blog
  , my résumé and finally my email and other social stuff.

<h2>My education</h2>
<p>Since when I was 13, I attended informatic-oriented schools. From 2001 to 2006 I attended
  Istituto Tecnico Commerciale <i>"V. Arangio Ruiz"</i>, graduating with 100/100. Next I switched
  to Roma Tre University, where I took my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in
  2009 with 110/110, and part of my thesis were presented as In Proceeding of IUI 2010
  Workshop on Social Recommender Systems (<a href="http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~lichen/srs2010/downloads/paper/18-A_Step_toward_Personalized_Social_Geotagging.pdf" target="_newtab">here</a>). 
  Nowadays I've graduated with full marks and took my Master Degree in
  Computer Science. I've developed a
  <a href="http://laetus.sourcefourge.net">parallel framework</a> as my senior thesis.
</p>

<h2>My skills</h2>
<p>I've a decent background in Java, being the language most taught within my university.
  By the way, I've studied on my own a bunch of other interesting programming languages:
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Haskell</li>
    <li>Common Lisp</li>
    <li>Clojure</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Python</h4>
<img class="instant itiltright icolorFFFCE9 ishadow50 right" src="img/me_and_BDFL.jpg" width="200">
<p>I've spent several months learning Python, due to its expressiveness, high level of abstraction
and power. Two years ago I attended the <i>"PyCon 3"</i> conference and I met <b>Guido
  Van Rossum</b>, the creator of the language.</p>
<p>I can consider Python one of my favourite languages, because it's easy to start with,
  and everything works like expected. I've even experience with a Python web framework,
  <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_newtab">Django</a>, because I've realized
  most of my Bachelor thesis with it. Python's lacks of concurrency can be fixed using some ad-hoc
  implementations, such as Stackless Python.
</p>

<h4>C/C++</h4>
<p>I'm relatively new to C++, but I like it a lot. I've started studying it through the excellent
  Meyers' book and Koenig's <i>"Accelerated C++"</i>. I've decided studying it due to my passion:
  if you want to be a game developer, forget Java! When performance matters, you need to know C/C++.
  I'm currently studying C++ advanced concept like Templates through the outstanding Andrei Alexandrescu's
  <i>Modern C++ Design: Applied Generic and Design Patterns</i>.
</p>

<h4>Haskell</h4>
<p>Haskell is an amazing functional language: it's expressive, smart, beautiful to write, and reasonably
fast. I started learning Haskell one year ago, but I stopped due to lack of time. Thanks to the
fantastic book <i>"Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!"</i>, though,  I was totally carried away from Haskell.
As a matter of fact, this site is written using a simple but powerful static website generator written in
Haskell, <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. Becoming a seasoned Haskell programmer is really
hard, but also incredibly rewarding.
</p>

<h4>Common Lisp</h4>
<p>Common Lisp is an amazing but underrated language. I've studied it due
  to my other passion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"
			  target="_newtab">functional languages</a>.<br>
  In my opinion functional programming is very funny and addictive, but you can love it or hate it.
  I've studied CL through the funniest book in the galaxy,
  <i> "The Land of Lisp: Learn to program in Lisp, one game at time."</i>
</p>

<h4>Clojure</h4>
<p>Sometimes called <i>"The modern Lisp"</i>, Clojure is a Lisp-like language with an eye to
  concurrency and dynamic programming (and metaprogramming). I love Clojure, so I've realizd 
  a bunch of project with it.
</p>

<h4>Lo and Behold</h4>
<p>The list of languages I've been exposed to is much longer, but these are the language I've
  used or I'm using most. You can find a detailed list of my Linkedin profile (search under
  <em>Hire me</em> section).
</p>

<h2>My attitude</h2>
<p>I don't have a clue about what will lie in store for me in the future,
  but I hope it will always be something exciting
  and challenging, something worth getting up in the morning. How Confucio said:
  <br><br><br><b>"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."</b>

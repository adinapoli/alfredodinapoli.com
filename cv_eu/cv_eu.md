### At glance

** Passionate Developer in love with functional programming **

    I'm an enthusiastic computer scientist who tries to find
    the most elegant solution for the problem at stake. I like
    to define myself a beauty-driven developer. Robert
    C. Martin's Clean Code is my bible, functional programming
    languages my inspiration. Quoting David Gelernter:
    "Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology
    because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defense against     
    complexity."

### Skills


* Architecture and Software Design

    1. Experience in designing and implementing mid-sized software architectures, using
    **Scrum** as agile development process.
    2. Basic experience as a team leader on small projects.

* Software Development

    1. Four years of experience in **Python** development, using **Django**.
    2. Two years of experience in **C++** development, with a focus on the new **C++11** 
    standard.
    3. One years of professional experience as functional developer, mainly **Scala**      
    and actor-based systems.
    4. Freelance/hobbyst **Haskell** coder.
    
* Quick prototyping

    I'm capable to choose the right tool for the right job and rapidly prototyping with         
    it an idea. I'm not constrained to a single language, but I consider myself a 
    **polyglot programmer**.

### Technical Buzzwords (in order of preference)

* Haskell
* OCaml
* Scala
* C/C++
* Python
* Common Lisp
* Clojure
* Java

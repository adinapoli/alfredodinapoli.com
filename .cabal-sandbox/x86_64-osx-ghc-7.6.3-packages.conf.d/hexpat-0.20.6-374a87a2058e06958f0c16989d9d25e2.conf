synopsis: XML parser/formatter based on expat
description: This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to
             do its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML
             parser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,
             @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.
             .
             Basic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).
             Other features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with
             XML source location (/Annotated/), extended XML trees with comments,
             processing instructions, etc (/Extended/), XML cursors (/Cursor/),
             SAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface in case speed
             is paramount (/Internal.IO/).
             .
             The design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity.
             .
             For introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,
             <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>
             .
             If you want to do interactive I\/O, an obvious option is to use lazy parsing
             with one of the lazy I\/O functions such as hGetContents.  However, this can be
             problematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\/O errors properly
             and can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup. Because of the generalized
             list, Hexpat is designed to allow for chunked I/O, but as of this writing I haven't
             done a nice integration with enumerator and friends.
             .
             /IO/ is filed under /Internal/ because it's low-level and most users won't want
             it.  The other /Internal/ modules are re-exported by /Annotated/, /Tree/ and /Extended/,
             so you won't need to import them directly.
             .
             Credits to Iavor Diatchki and the @xml@ (XML.Light) package for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.
             Thanks to the many contributors.
             .
             ChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\"
             that seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse;
             0.16 switch from mtl to transformers; 0.17 fix mapNodeContainer & rename some things.;
             0.18 rename defaultEncoding to overrideEncoding. 0.18.3 formatG and indent were demanding list
             items more than once (inefficient in chunked processing); 0.19 add Extended.hs;
             0.19.1 fix a memory leak introduced in 0.19, delegate parsing to bound thread
             if unbound (see note above); 0.19.2 include expat source code so \'cabal install\' just works
             on Linux, Mac and Windows (thanks Jacob Stanley); 0.19.3 fix misconfiguration of expat
             which broke entity parsing; 0.19.4 bump version constraint for text; 0.19.5 bump text
             to < 0.12 and fix text-0.10.0.1 breakage; 0.19.6 dependency breakage with List;
             0.19.7 ghc-7.2.1 compatibility; 0.19.8 fix space leak on lazy parse under ghc-7.2.1;
             0.19.9 fix formatting of > character + improve performance; 0.19.10 ghc-7.4.x compatibility;
             0.20.1 fix an unfortunate crash when used in parallel processing and greatly improve
             performance; 0.20.2 make parseSaxG lazier; 0.20.3 minor build issues; 0.20.4 remove
             dependency on extensible-exceptions; 0.20.5 bump text upper bound; 0.20.6 bump text again
             to include 1.1.0.0.

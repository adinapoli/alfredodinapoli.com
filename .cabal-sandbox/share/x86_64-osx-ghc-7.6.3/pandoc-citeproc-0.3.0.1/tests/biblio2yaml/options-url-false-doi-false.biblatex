Entry contains url and doi fields; these should be discarded since the
options field specifies url=false, doi=false.

Exception: As in standard biblatex, in online entries url should never be
discarded, even if options contains url=false.

    Author = {Author, Andy},
    Date = {2012},
    Doi = {1234/5678.90},
    Journal = {Journal},

    Title = {Title, Any Entry Type Except online},
    Url = {http://foo.bar}

@comment{
    - contains:
        - an article entry with just the required fields
        - an article entry with required and all optional fields
    - notes:
        - year, month to be ignored if date is present
        - journal to be ignored if journaltitle is present
        - editortype, editoratype, editorbtype, editorctype, pubstate,
series contain keys which, unless corresponding CSL terms exist, require
locale-specific expansion
    - limitations:
        - annotator, commentator, eid, eprint, eprintclass, eprinttype,
issuetitle, issuesubtitle, language, origlanguage have no matching
counterparts in CSL
        - for editor, editora, editorb, editorc (plus editortype,
editoratype, editorbtype, editorctype) only a subset, editor and director,
has matching counterparts in CSL
    - kludges:
        - note + addendum -> CSL note
        - number + issue -> CSL issue
        - handling of titleaddon
        - handling of (journal) series
            - done properly, this should be mapped to some CSL variable
(version? edition? collection-number?), CSL styles would have to be adapted
            - slightly better kludge would map integer to ordinal + "ser."
("3" -> "3rd ser."); localization keys "newseries" -> "new ser.",
"oldseries" -> "old ser."; and print all other values as is -- but still
wouldn't fit all styles or locales.

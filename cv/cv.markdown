## What I believe in

I believe in **beauty**.

I consider programming a **creative art**, just like painting or writing.
Obviously I'm not saying that painting like Caravaggio is the same thing of
programming an operating system, but the principles that guide the process
should be the same.

<div class="glance-box" markdown="1">
Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology
because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defense
against complexity.

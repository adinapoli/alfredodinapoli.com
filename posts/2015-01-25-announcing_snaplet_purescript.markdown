Today I'm open sourcing and releasing for public consumption
[snaplet-purescript](https://github.com/adinapoli/snaplet-purescript),
a simple snaplet which brings automatic recompilation of
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) projects into your
Snap application.

It was heavily inspired to [snaplet-fay](https://github.com/faylang/snaplet-fay),
so some credits to Adam Bergmark and Chris Done are due!

The Github project ships with an example app to help get
you started.

As always, feedback, bug reports and PRs are welcome!

Alfredo

description: A report of this closing year

2012 has been a big deal for me:

* On May I graduated, taking my master degree
  in computer science after 5 years of hard work. 

* On July, I've successfully passed the Cambridge exam for
  the CAE certificate. This means I now have the C1 level in English.

* On June I started my first work. I landed an internship at [MBDA](http://www.mbda-systems.com/).

* I started contributing on my first Haskell open source project, [Snap](http://snapframework.com/).
  Working on another, high-regarded project has been a wonderful experience,
  I've learned a lot and I had the satisfaction to see the result of my work
  included in a new release.

* On November, I landed a job on functional programming (Scala to be precise)
  at [Cake Solutions](http://cakesolutions.net).

##What I want from 2013

* A better understanding of Haskell. I'm on the right track, but I want to
  make the jump into the advanced world.

* Slightly related to the first point, I want to build myself a small algebra
  background, especially in the category theory. I will help me to sharpen my
  Haskell's skills as well.

* I want to submit at least a tiny patch to GHC, because I want to be a part
  of the community and do my part.

* I want to continue improving Snap and helping Doug and the other outstanding
  devs to make it better.

I will be a hard path to take, but I think it will be rewarding.
Happy new year everyone,

Alfredo

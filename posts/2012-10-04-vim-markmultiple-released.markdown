I've released a simple plugin that does pretty much what this plugin does:

[mark-multiple.el](https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el)

Nothing particularly thrilling or something you can't live without, but I
think it's handy and after all, if Emacs can do that, why Vim can't?
Without further ado, this is the github repository:

[vim-markmultiple](https://github.com/adinapoli/vim-markmultiple)

Feedback are welcome.

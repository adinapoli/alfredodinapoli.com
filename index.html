<p>Hi, I'm Alfredo Di Napoli, and I'm a 23 years old guy with passion for 3D graphics and game design.
  Since when I was young, I looked with amazed glance to the 8 bit games, and emotions and passion 
  survived until now. My childhood dream is to be a part of a game development team, and develop 
  the same games entertained me as child.</p>

<p>Within this site you will find every kind of informations about me: my portfolio, my blog 
  (externally hosted, for now), where I'm currently living and finally my email and other social stuff.
  And If you are the CEO of a game development company, just click on the "Hire me" button!

<h2>My education</h2>
<p>Since when I was 13, I attended informatic oriented schools. From 2001 to 2006 I attended 
  Istituto Tecnico Commerciale <i>"V. Arangio Ruiz"</i>, graduading with 100/100. Next I moved 
  to Roma Tre University, where I took my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in 
  2009 with 110/110, and part of my thesis were presented as In Proceeding of IUI 2010 
  Workshop on Social Recommender Systems (<a href="http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~lichen/srs2010/downloads/paper/18-A_Step_toward_Personalized_Social_Geotagging.pdf" target="_newtab">here</a>). 
  Nowadays I'm next to Master of Science.
</p>

<h2>My skills</h2>
<p>I've a discrete background in Java, being the language most teached within my university. 
  By the way, I've studied on my own a bunch of other interesting programming languages: 
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Common Lisp</li>
    <li>Clojure</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Python</h4>
<img class="instant itiltright icolorFFFCE9 ishadow50 right" src="img/me_and_BDFL.jpg" width="200px">
<p>I've spent several months learning Python, due to its expressiveness, high level of abstraction 
  and power. Two years ago I've attended the <i>"PyCon 3"</i> conference and I've met Guido 
  Van Rossum, the creator of the language.</p>
<p>I can consider Python one of my favourite languages, because it's easy to start with, 
  and everything works like expected. I've even experience with a Python web framework, 
  <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_newtab">Django</a>, because I've realized 
  most of my Bachelor thesis with it. Python's lacks of concurrency can be fixed using some ad-hoc
  implementations, such as Stackless Python.
</p>

<h4>C/C++</h4>
<p>I'm relatively new to C++, but I'm liking it a lot. I've started studying it trough the excellent
  Meyers' books and Koenig's <i>"Accelerated C++"</i>. I decided studying it due to my passion: 
  if you want to be a game developer, forget Java! When performance matters, you need to know C/C++.
</p>

<h4>Common Lisp</h4>
<p>Common Lisp is an amazing but underrated language. I've studied it due 
  to my other passion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" 
			  target="_newtab">functional languages</a>.<br>
  In my opinion functional programming is very funny and addictive, but you can love it or hate it. 
  I've studied CL through the funniest book in the galaxy,
  <i> "The Land of Lisp: Learn to program in Lisp, one game at time."</i>
</p>

<h4>Clojure</h4>
<p>Sometimes called <i>"The modern Lisp"</i>, Clojure is a Lisp-like language with an eye to 
  concurrency and dynamic programming (and metaprogramming). I love Clojure, so I've realized 
  a bunch of project with it.
</p>

<h4>Lo and Behold</h4>
<p>The list of languages I've been exposed to is much longer, but these are the language I've 
  used or I'm using most. You can find a detailed list of my Linkedin profile (search under 
  Hire me section).
</p>

<h2>The future</h2>
<p>I don't know what I'm going to do after graduating, but I hope it will be something exciting
  and challenging, something worth getting up in the morning. How Confucio said: 
  <br><br><br><b>"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."</b>
